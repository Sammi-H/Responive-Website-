## Project Overview (First time building a website)

**Web Application:** Manage All Your Money in One App

This web application features a simple and responsive design that allows the user to toggle between light and dark mode. Although the functionality is limited, the project provides an opportunity to learn about responsive web design and the use of CSS variables.

### Key Learnings

Through this project, I have:
- Gained a deeper understanding of the **CSS box model**, helping me effectively manage margins, padding, and borders.
- Learned the basics of **CSS Grid**, which has enhanced my ability to create responsive layouts.
- Understood how to structure **HTML** using div elements and **nested divs**, which is crucial for creating organized and readable documents.

These skills will be valuable for future projects and job opportunities.
